                Scientific support for phytoremediation — that’s the word for plants scrubbing contaminants from the air — usually begins with a NASA study conducted in the 1980s.
Researchers then were looking for ways to improve the air quality in a sealed spacecraft, and they concluded that the roots and soil of houseplants reduced airborne volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly.
Since those early studies, researchers have both confirmed those findings and called them into questionTrusted Source.
Recent findings suggest that you’d have to shelter a large number of plants to equal the air purifying efficiency of modern biofilters and other technologies.
If you do decide to purchase houseplants to freshen the air naturally, these are several of the species shownTrusted Source to be most effective:
areca, lady, dwarf date, and bamboo palms
Boston fern
rubber tree
spider plant
Ficus tree
